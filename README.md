## 🛡️ Malware Scanner

AuroraFile scans recursively for suspicious PHP patterns:
- Dangerous functions: `eval()`, `exec()`, `assert()`, etc.
- Obfuscation techniques: `base64_decode()`, `gzinflate()`
- Webshell names: `b374k`, `c99shell`, `wso`
- Variable-variable attacks (`$$var`)
- Backdoor behaviors (`include($_GET['x'])`)
